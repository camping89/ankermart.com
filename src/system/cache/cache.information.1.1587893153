Paypal is the easiest way to make payments online. While checking out your order, you will be redirected to the Paypal website. Be sure to fill in correct details for fast &amp;amp; hassle-free payment processing. After a successful Paypal payment, a payment advice will be automatically generated to the ankermart.com system for your order. It's fast, easy &amp;amp; secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT PAYMENT METHODS DOES ANKERMART ACCEPT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
PayPal is currently the only payment method accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAN I PAY USING PAYPAL WITHOUT A PAYPAL ACCOUNT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yes! It is commonly misunderstood that a Paypal account is needed in order to make payments through Paypal. The truth is you DO NOT need one, although we strongly recommend you sign up to enjoy the added ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a Paypal account, all you need is any Debit/Credit card stated below that is supported by Paypal. By using Paypal, we can process &amp;amp; deliver your orders to you in a shorter time. Paypal is the easiest &amp;amp; most secure way to make payments online. No account needed.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAN I CHANGE MY ORDER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO SHIPPING COSTS DECREASE WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE ITEMS IN AN ORDER?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When multiple items are ordered together, shipping cost is usually reduced according to weight and size, safety and insurance required. Simply place all items in the shopping cart, pick the state and method of shipping and apply the shipping calculator.&amp;nbsp;Please note that the delivery of orders with more than one item may ship on different dates according to stock availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR ANKERMART TO PROCESS AN RMA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
